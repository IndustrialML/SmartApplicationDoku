We will try to get an insight of the possible challenges and problems, when building a live application for production that solves a complex machine learning problem, involving both software engineers and data analysts. The smart application will include the following tasks (amongst others):
* Fetching data from different sources
* Preprocessing the data
* Training a machine learning model
* Using the trained model to make live predictions
* Being able to easily replace the prediction model with new model versions

Furthermore we want to demonstrate a full process cycle, helping you to prepare for your own project.

## Transfer a machine learning model between technologies
As you might have experienced, the technologie stack used by data analysts will most certainly not match with the one used for building big applications in a business environment. For example, the data analyst might use R or Python to explore data, extract features and train a machine learning algorithm, but the software engineer wants to build his enterprise application with Java EE or Spring Boot. Therefore one of the big challenges can be, to provide the prediction service of the trained model, to be used by the enterprise application.
